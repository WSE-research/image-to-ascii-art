DESCRIPTION = "\nYou want to create ASCII art from a given picture? Then you've come to the right place. This tool provides a **fast and automated** way to interactively create ASCII art from an existing image (either uploaded from your local machine or download from a URL). You might use this in your applications (e.g., in the `banner.txt` file of [Spring Boot applications](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-custom-banners)). Several methods are implemented here in different approaches for convenient comparison. Some support colorized characters, or colorized background of characters, taking the colors from the given image (see [full feature list](https://github.com/WSE-research/image-to-ascii-art/#image-to-ascii-converter)). Choose for yourself the best approach regarding your image and use case. Have fun.\n\nSee the sidebar for configuring this tool's behavior. For more details, see our [GitHub repository](%s) where you can also [submit bug reports](%s) and [feature requests](%s)."
