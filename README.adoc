= Image To ASCII Converter

You want to create ASCII art from your images? 
Then this tool is for you.
It is a web application that allows you to upload an image and convert it to ASCII art.
Here, we did not implement yet another image-to-ASCII conversion algorithm. 
Instead, we use existing implementations and provide a web interface for them, s.t., the configuration and conversion can be done in the browser.
The application is based on https://github.com/TheZoraiz/ascii-image-converter[ascii-image-converter] (available as console application) and https://github.com/LeandroBarone/python-ascii_magic[ASCII magic] (Python library), so thanks for image generation go to the authors of these projects.
However, our tool provides additional features like SVG, PNG, and ASCII export as well as a preview mode and many more.
Here, we focus on providing an easy-to-use web interface that makes it easy to convert images to ASCII art and to compare different results.
This tool was implemented using the https://streamlit.io/[Streamlit] library.

== Features

* Upload an image *or* directly use an image from the web
* Convert the image to ASCII art using 9 different algorithms/configurations (all of them are shown )
** 3 with colorized characters (2 from ascii-image-converter, 1 from ASCII magic)
** 3 with colorized character backgrounds (all from ascii-image-converter)
*** with a limited set of characters and a background color based on the average color of the pixels
*** with an extended set of characters and a background color based on the average color of the pixels
*** without characters and only background colors per position based on the average color of the pixels
** 3 without using colors at all, i.e., only using characters (2 from ascii-image-converter, 1 from ASCII magic)
* 24-bit colors are used to provide best quality
* Preview the different versions of the generated ASCII art 
* Define the preview background color (to simulate the background color of the target medium)
* Download the generated ASCII art as scalable image for lossless scaling (SVG), PNG, or plain ASCII text (e.g., to use it for a https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-custom-banners[banner.txt] of a Spring application)
** note, even the text-based ASCII format will include the colors definitions using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors[ANSI escape codes] (supported by most shells)
* Interactive configuration of the conversion process


== Online Demo 

The demo is available at https://demos.swe.htwk-leipzig.de/image-to-ascii-art/. 
Please note that the file upload limit is set here to 1 MB (definitely suitable for good quality). 

== Building and Running the Application

=== Running locally without Python

==== Install dependencies

===== Install Python dependencies

[source, bash]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

===== Install other dependencies

Note: just tested on Linux systems.

* https://github.com/TheZoraiz/ascii-image-converter[ascii-image-converter]
* https://inkscape.org/[Inkscape]

==== Run the Application

First, you neet to define the location of the directory where the application should store the temporary files (e.g.., the image files). 
Example:

[source, bash]
----
export UPLOAD_DIRECTORY=/tmp/image-to-ascii-art
----

Thereafter, you can run the application using the following command:

[source, bash]
----
streamlit run image-to-ascii-art-converter-web-ui.py --server.port=8501 
----

or 

[source, bash]
----
python -m streamlit run image-to-ascii-art-converter-web-ui.py --server.port=8501
----

Thereafter, you can access the application at http://localhost:8501.

=== Docker

The application is available at https://hub.docker.com/r/wseresearch/image-to-ascii-art[Dockerhub] for free use in your environment.

==== Build Docker Image

[source, bash]
----
docker build -t image-to-ascii-art:latest . 
----

If you want to increase the upload larger, then change the `server.maxUploadSize` in the {github-repository}/blob/main/[Dockerfile]: 

[source, bash]
----
# set the limit to 5 MB
server.maxUploadSize=5 
----


==== Run Docker Image

[source, bash]
----
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 --name image-to-ascii-art image-to-ascii-art:latest
----

Thereafter, you can access the application at http://localhost:8501.
